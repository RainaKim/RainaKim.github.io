Industrialisation, the second transition described by Eric Gill, took away most of what was left. But it’s the third transition that stripped it naked. Typefaces are faceless these days. They’re just fonts on our computers. Hardly anyone knows their stories. Hardly anyone cares. Flicking through thousands of typefaces and finding the “right one” is a matter of minutes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the new computer age the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones, and trash the rest.</p>\n<p>— Massimo Vignelli</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Typography is not about typefaces. It’s not about what looks best, it’s about what feels right. What communicates the message best. Typography, in its essence, is about the message. “Typographical design should perform optically what the speaker creates through voice and gesture of his thoughts.”, as El Lissitzky, a famous Russian typographer, put it.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/git-and-github","tagSlugs":["/tag/git/","/tag/github/","/tag/web-development/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-04-29T22:40:32.169Z","description":"Using git commands and github platform.
