Git is a VCS(Version Control System), which is a system that manages change history of our source code. Code version management is needed when developing in team unit. Basically it can rollback to any point that we want to go back. Quite systematic and interactive teamwork will be created!!

## Git Basics

When managing the file version using git, file will be under progress of one of the three states.
- **Committed**
	- edited files are saved in git
- **Modified**
	- edited files that are yet to be committed
- **Staged**
	- One step further from modified file and marked to be committed soon, which means the intermediate step of modified and committed
	- Committing is for final completion, so staging is useful when intermediate progress needs to be saved before final completion


## Git Flow

The first transition took away a large part of humanity from written communication. Industrialisation, the second transition described by Eric Gill, took away most of what was left. But it’s the third transition that stripped it naked. Typefaces are faceless these days. They’re just fonts on our computers. Hardly anyone knows their stories. Hardly anyone cares. Flicking through thousands of typefaces and finding the “right one” is a matter of minutes.

> In the new computer age the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones, and trash the rest.

— Massimo Vignelli

Typography is not about typefaces. It’s not about what looks best, it’s about what feels right. What communicates the message best. Typography, in its essence, is about the message. “Typographical design should perform optically what the speaker creates through voice and gesture of his thoughts.”, as El Lissitzky, a famous Russian typographer, put it.
